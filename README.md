# Wizardry 🧙🏾‍♂️

> A great and powerful ~~script~~ **spell** for configuring macOS. Forked from [formation](https://github.com/minamarkham/formation).

It can be run multiple times on the same machine safely. It installs, upgrades, or skips packages based on what is already installed on the machine.

## Customization

> Because there’s no place like `~`.

This script is designed to be _customized_. As is, `customizations` clones and configure _my_ [dotfiles](https://github.com/nirmal-mekala/dotfiles) and macOS preferences—including setting a [seasonal desktop background](https://github.com/nirmal-mekala/bgs).

## Usage

Read through the scripts before running so you know what’s going on.

If you’re feeling lucky, you can simply run:

```sh
./configuratio_maculus
```
Or, to run and save output:

```sh
./configuratio_maculus 2>&1 | tee ~/configuratio_maculus.log
```

## What’s Included

This script installs the macOS and CLI utilities, apps, text editors, IDEs, and nerd fonts that I use to stay productive. Browse through the `installs` directory to see what it includes.

## Known Issues

Cask does not recognize applications installed outside of Homebrew Cask – in the case that the script fails, you can either remove the application from the install list or uninstall the application causing the failure and try again.

## Acknowledgements
